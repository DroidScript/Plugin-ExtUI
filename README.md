# Plugin-UserPlugin

Created by Alexandr Strashko
 
A DroidScript plugin that provides numerous Android widgets and generic Android API access

PLEASE NOTE: Plugins built with Android Studio will only work when built in RELEASE mode. Also, you cannot install the APK in the normal fashion.  It must be copied to the /DroidScript/Plugins folder on the internal sdcard and the DroidScript app restarted (an example Install.bat is included to help with this).

Please ask/search on the DroidScript forum for more information:- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/androidscript
